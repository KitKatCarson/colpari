# README #

This project is an extension designed to run on the AWESOME SUPPORT Wordpress Plugin Platform.  
Give it a posttype that has a TITLE and a date and it will use that posttype as a source for suggestions
when the user tries to open a ticket.  It will also create a drop-down in the REPLY area of the TICKET so that 
the agent can easily link to them.

### How do I get set up? ###

Installation is straightforward using the usual WordPress Plugins -> Add New procedure.

- Download the file from your receipt or from your dashboard(Awesome-Support-Custom-Faqs.zip).
- Within WordPress Dashboard, click `Plugins` -> `Add New`
